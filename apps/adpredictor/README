(1) To generate input impressions:

% mkdir inputs
% make gen_inputs
% ./gen_inputs <num_impressions>

(2) To build and run software:

% make
% ./adp -n <num_cpus> <num_impressions>

Note that input files need to be larger (or the same size) as the problem size called. It is easiest to generate very large inputs once (~10,000,000) and use this for all execution.
